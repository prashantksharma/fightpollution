## Fight Pollution - with common sense

The goal of this project is to explore **simple** ways to fight pollution which are **scalable** using the common sense approach as oppossed to using fancy and/or expensive techonology.

## Why we are doing this ?

Inspired by the [Ice Stupa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dChiLpYifs) and other projects by [Sonam Wangchuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonam_Wangchuk_(engineer)) which are so impactful but at the same time so simple in the approach towards solving pressing issues. We decided to find simple but effective solution to the problem of pollution in cities (eg. Delhi).
